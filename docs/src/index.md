# OpticalPolynomials.jl

OpticalPolynomials contains functions for quickly computing the various polynomials used in optics.  At this time, support is present for [Zernike](Zernike.md), [Chebyshev](Chebyshev.md), [Legendre](Legendre.md), and [Jacobi](Jacobi.md) polynomials.  Future support is planned for Forbes' Q polynomials, each of Qbfs, Qcon, and 2D-Q.

## Installation

OpticalPolynomials is a registered Julia package, it may be installed the usual way:

```
julia> Pkg.add("OpticalPolynomials")
```

For information on usage for each polynomial set, see the previously linked pages.
